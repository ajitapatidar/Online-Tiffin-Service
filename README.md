# Online-Tiffin-Service
 Online Tiffin Service System is a frontend-based web application which  strives to make an online portal for both vendors and customers.
 In Online Tiffin Service System we use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies. 
 This project keeps records of Tiffin orders and has three modules: admin, vendor, and customers.
